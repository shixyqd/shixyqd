This project "API on Cryptocurrency market" includes a python package that make a request to an external API.

It is the final project of my course Modern Data Structures during my graduate study at the QMSS (Quantitative
Methods in the Social Sciences) program at Columbia University.

It retrieves data for a given cryptocurrency asset, and filters the results based on specified optional parameters 
including size, name of exchange, base asset and quote asset. Additionally, the function includes error handling and 
type hints to improve its readability and robustness.

The Project.ipynb is the main file that illustrate the use case of my function "get_exchange_prices."
This folder also includes a project proposal, the files of the get_exchange_price function and a test of the function.

I am interested in data science and its application in finance, and always excited to discuss other projects and reseach of mine with everyone! :)
