### Hi there 👋

<!--
**shixyqd/shixyqd** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently a first-year graduate student in the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) program at Columbia University.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data structures, machine learning, data analysis.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects about data science using python and R
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with SQL, and projects about data engineering
- 💬 Ask me about economics, political economy, and environmental policy
- 📫 How to reach me: shixyqd@outlook.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love indie & alternative music from the 90s. Most of my favorite bands are from that period and I've been to lots of concerts since I came to New York!
